# Description
This is a RESTful API built using nodejs and express and mongodb as a db
## Details 
I built this API to learn more about docker feel free to use the docker files it will work with your project just change the path and whatever needs to be changed.

## How to use it
1. To start containers un this command 
``` bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up 
```
2. To stop the containers run this command 
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down
```

These containers depend on node and mongodb images make sure you have them set up before running these commands.
